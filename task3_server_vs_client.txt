Server-side rendering (SSR) happens on the server before the page is sent to the client. It's useful for dynamic content, such as authenticated pages. 

On the other hand, client-side rendering (CSR) takes place in the browser after the initial HTML is delivered. This approach is suitable for interactive components like user dashboards. 

Both SSR and CSR can be combined in a Next.js app to optimize performance and user experience depending on the needs of each page.
